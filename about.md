**What is patocarr.com?**

It's a personal site dedicated to sharing stories, events, trips and an assorted collection of computer knowledge and experiences.

**Who are you?**

My name is Patricio Carr. I'm more or less 45 years old, married with two beautiful offspring. I work in high technology for a medium-sized company, specializing in high performance data acquisition computer boards as a digital design engineer. Before this, I worked for several companies in a wide range of technical duties, from management system software, web design, firmware developer, hardware verification engineer and printed circuit board designer.

**Digital life**

My computing life begun with a loaned Atari 800 and its BASIC programming language. Next came the Commodore-64 and C-128 where using a disk editor I would modify games' strings so they'd read "Patocarr was here" when the game was run.
Strangely, the next jump was Unix with its dBase where I wrote my first database programs. Years later DOS will arrive and with it, learned assembly and hijacking <acronym title="Interrupt requests">IRQs</acronym> to make <acronym title="Terminate and stay resident">TSR</acronym> programs. Also helped save years of data by writing low level drive access routines to recover from a hard drive crash.

**Operating Systems**

After the fruitful DOS days and peer to peer networking, I dispassionately started using Microsoft Windows from the 3.11 Windows For Workgroups, to the more stable Windows 7, passing through 95, 98, Me, Vista and XP. While I never got to the expert level, I consider myself a power-user. In all honesty though, always thought it was a necessary evil to get any work done with a computer. Then Linux came along. Oh what a geek's playground!
Over the last 15 years or so, I tried dozens of distributions, recently settling on RedHat (CentOS) for servers, Fedora, Ubuntu and Mint for desktops. In my hacking days, I compiled my own kernels and some bleeding edge packages (ie. Firefox). Also dabbled in scripting languages like Perl, Ruby, Python, Bash, Tcl/Tk and others.

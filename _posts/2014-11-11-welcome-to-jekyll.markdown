This is my first blog post taken from the Jekyll installation. Jekyll is a static site generator that is blog-aware and makes it real easy to convert text to static html pages through the use of a templating engine.

I have no idea what I will write (or if I ever will) in this blog, but as [Jekyll][jekyll] comes with everything to get a blog going, might as well add it.

The text below comes in the one post that gets generated as the first Jekyll example post. In a nutshell, there's one file per post, written in markdown, textile or even html, that gets processed and spits a static html page ready to be uploaded to a site.


You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
